# dirlist-depth
I created this project to learn more about the Rust. While making this little
cli, I am reading the second edition of 'The Rust Programming Language' as well
as 'Rust for Rustaceons' and making changes as I go along. For this reason I 
will not be documenting very elaborately. If someone somehow finds some genuine
interest, I might do a better job at that. The documentation might not be up-to-date
for aforementioned reasons.

I won't publish it to cargo (yet?) so everything is based on running it with cargo.
